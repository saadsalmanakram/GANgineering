- Definition: DCGAN is an extension of GANs that incorporates deep convolutional networks into both the generator and discriminator, designed to improve the generation of realistic images.

- Key Features:
  1- Uses convolutional and transposed convolutional layers instead of fully connected layers.
  2- Employs batch normalization to stabilize training.
  3- Leaky ReLU activation functions are used to prevent issues like vanishing gradients.

- Purpose: To generate more realistic and high-quality images, specifically to improve the performance of GANs in image synthesis tasks by leveraging the strengths of convolutional networks.
