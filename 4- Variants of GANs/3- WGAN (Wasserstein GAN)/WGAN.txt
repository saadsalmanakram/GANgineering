- Definition: WGAN is a GAN variant that improves the stability and convergence of GAN training by using the Wasserstein distance as a loss function, which provides more reliable gradients and mitigates issues like mode collapse.

- Key Features:
  1- Uses Wasserstein distance (Earth Mover's Distance) as a loss function.
  2- Replaces the discriminator with a "critic" network that scores realness instead of classifying real vs. fake.
  3- Enforces a Lipschitz constraint through weight clipping or gradient penalty.

- Purpose: To enhance the stability and reliability of GAN training, making it easier to train GANs and produce more diverse and higher-quality outputs.
