- For each epoch:

  1- Train the Discriminator on a batch of real data and a batch of fake data generated by the Generator.
  
  2- Train the Generator by passing noise through it and updating its weights based on how well it fooled the Discriminator.
  
  3- Monitor the losses and generated outputs to ensure the training process is progressing as expected.
