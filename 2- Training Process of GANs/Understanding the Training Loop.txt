Train Discriminator:
- Sample real data from the dataset.
- Generate fake data using the Generator.
- Calculate and backpropagate the Discriminator's loss to update its weights.

Train Generator:
- Generate fake data again.
- Calculate and backpropagate the Generator's loss to update its weights based on how well it fooled the Discriminator.

Repeat:
- Repeat these steps for many iterations, allowing the networks to gradually improve.
